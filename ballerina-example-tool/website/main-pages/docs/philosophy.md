                    <p>Cloud native and microservices architectures enable enterprises to have trillions of programmable network endpoints, making integration the glue that brings APIs, microservices, and data together as a whole. Centralized and configuration-driven approaches to integration, with ESBs, are not agile or cloud native. Programming languages with frameworks like Spring and Node.js offer agility but require writing a lot of complex and boilerplate code to integrate endpoints. </p>

            <h3>ACTORS AND ACTIONS</h3>
            <p>Ballerina represents clients, workers, and remote systems as different actors in the sequence diagram. In code, remote endpoints are interfaced via connectors, which offer type-safe actions. Graphically, each connector is represented as an actor in the sequence diagram (i.e., a vertical line) and actions are represented as interactions with those actors.</p>

            <h3>SEQUENCE DIAGRAMS AND CONCURRENCY</h3>
            <p>Ballerina’s concurrency model is parallel-first since interactions with remote parties always involve multiple workers. Interactions between workers are handled as message passing, with no shared state.</p>

         <div class="cPhil-title-boxes-container cPhil-title-boxes-container-white">
            <h3>WORKER SEMANTICS</h3>
            <p>Ballerina’s execution model is composed of lightweight parallel execution units known as workers. Workers use non-blocking policies to ensure no function locks an executing thread, such as an HTTP I/O call awaiting response.</p>

            <h3>TYPE SAFETY</h3>
            <p>Ballerina has a structural type system with primitive, record, object, tuple, and union types. This type-safe model incorporates type inference at assignment and provides numerous compile time integrity checks for connectors, logic, and network-bound payloads.  </p>

            <h3>UNION TYPES AND EXPLICIT NULLS</h3>
            <p>Individual network endpoints often return messages with different payload types and errors, depending on their inputs and logic. Ballerina’s type system embraces this variability with an approach based on union types. Union types explicitly capture this semantics without requiring developers to create unnecessary “wrapper” types. This approach also enhances the handling of null values. By default, types do not support null values. Developers must explicitly create union types to handle nulls. The result is that null exceptions cannot happen and the language syntax and compiler identifies whether null handling logic is required or not.</p>

            <p>The Ballerina type system has rich built in support for JSON, XML, streams and tables, as well as direct support for ProtoBuf and gRPC. The result is clean, readable code for dealing with network payloads, SQL programming and stream processing. Data transformation logic isn’t encumbered with complex generated types, third-party library code or other obfuscation - simple clear readable code captures interactions with heterogeneous data and transformation logic.</p>

            <p>This ensures that malicious data received by the program does not propagate through a system. In Ballerina, functions can mark returned values as tainted.

            <h3>OPINIONATED TOOLCHAIN</h3>
            <p>Over the past 15 years, best practices and expectations on the associated toolset that a language provides have evolved. Now, a language is not ready for adoption unless it includes a unit test framework, build system, documentation generation, dependency management and versioning, and a way to share modules of reusable code. Ballerina includes all of these subsystems as part of its core distribution so that there is no risk of community drift, which is what happens when the ecosystem needs to build tools on top of a language instead of designing it within the language. </p>

            <h3>PACKAGE MANAGEMENT</h3>
            <p>Ballerina’s package management, dependency and versioning model is based on learnings from Docker, Elm, and NPM. While it is possible to build and run individual Ballerina source files, packages (modules) can only be built as part of a project, which is managed by Ballerina. Every project has its own dependency cache and all packages are versioned according to semver rules. Strict rules limit dependency conflicts from applications that import packages from a central registry. Packages can be pushed to Ballerina Central and shared with the other users.</p>

            <p>Ballerina’s language and annotations are intentionally environment-aware, treating these other components as syntactical objects and also relationships as decorated annotations. By having the language and build system be environmentally aware of other components surrounding our service, we can generate essential artifact code ahead of CI/CD, perform data and integrity checks around network-bound payloads, and pre-package dependent but not yet deployed components as part of the Ballerina binary.</p>
