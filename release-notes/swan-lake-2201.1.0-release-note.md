### Developer Tools Updates

#### New Features

##### AsyncAPI Tool

- Ballerina AsyncAPI tooling will make it easy for you to start the development of an event API documented in an AsyncAPI contract in Ballerina by generating Ballerina service and listener skeletons. Ballerina Swan Lake supports the AsyncAPI Specification version 2.x. For more information, see [Ballerina AsyncAPI support](http://ballerina.io/learn/ballerina-asyncapi-support) and [AsyncAPI CLI documentation](http://ballerina.io/learn/cli-documentation/asyncapi/#asyncapi-to-ballerina).

##### GraphQL Tool

- Introduced the Ballerina GraphQL tool, which will make it easy for you to generate a client in Ballerina given the GraphQL schema (SDL) and GraphQL queries. Ballerina Swan Lake supports the GraphQL specification [October 2021 edition](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/). For more information, see [Ballerina GraphQL support](http://ballerina.io/learn/ballerina-graphql-support/) and [Graphql CLI documentation](http://ballerina.io/learn/cli-documentation/graphql/#graphql-to-ballerina).

##### Language Server

- Added completion and code action support for already-imported modules in the Ballerina user home
- Implemented file operation events in the Language Server

#### Improvements

##### Debugger
- Added rutime breakpoint verification support. With this improvement, the debugger is expected to verify all the valid breakpoint locations in the current debug source. All the breakpoints that are set on non-executable lines of code (i.e., Ballerina line comments, documentation , blank lines, declarations, etc.) will be marked as `unverified` in the editor.

##### Language Server

- Improve the `Document this code` action to support module-level variables
- Added signature help for included record params
- Revamp the code action utilities introducing a new API to find the top-level node for a given code action context
- Improved completion item sorting in several contexts
- Improved the `Create function` code action to handle named arguments
- Improved the `Create function` code action to add an isolated qualifier
- Added signature help for union-typed expressions
