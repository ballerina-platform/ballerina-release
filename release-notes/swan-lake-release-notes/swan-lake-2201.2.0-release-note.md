If you are already using Ballerina, use the [Ballerina update tool](/learn/cli-documentation/update-tool/#using-the-update-tool) to directly update to 2201.2.0 (Swan Lake). To do this: 

1. Run the command below to get the latest version of the update tool.

   `bal update`

2. Run the command below to update your Ballerina version to 2201.2.0 (Swan Lake).

   `bal dist update`

#### Troubleshoot

##### For macOS Users (`.pkg` installations)

1. Run the `rm ~/.ballerina/ballerina-version` command to delete the version configuration.
2. Run the `chmod 755 /Library/Ballerina/distributions/ballerina-2201.2.0/bin/bal` command to provide execute permissions for the `bal` command.
3. Run the `bal dist use 2201.2.0` command to switch to the 2201.2.0 version. 

##### For Ubuntu Users (`.deb` installations)

1. Run the `rm ~/.ballerina/ballerina-version` command to delete the version configuration.
2. Run the `chmod 755 /usr/lib/ballerina/distributions/ballerina-2201.2.0/bin/bal` command to provide execute permissions for the `bal` command.
3. Run the `bal dist use 2201.2.0` command to switch to the 2201.2.0 version.

##### For CentOS Users (`.rpm` installations)

### Install Ballerina

If you have not installed Ballerina, then download the [installers](/downloads/#swanlake) to install.

### Migrate from Swan Lake Beta releases
>**Info:** If you have been using Swan Lake Beta releases, delete the `Dependencies.toml` files in your Ballerina packages when migrating to Balelrina 2201.2.0 (Swan Lake). 

A few backward-incompatible changes have been introduced during the Swan Lake Beta program, and thereby, some of your existing packages may not compile with Ballerina 2201.2.0 (Swan Lake). Therefore, you need to delete the `Dependencies.toml` file to force the dependency resolver to use the latest versions of your dependencies.

### Developer tools updates

#### New features

##### SemVer validator CLI tool (Experimental)
Introduced the `bal semver` CLI command, which attempts to validate <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> compatibility of the local package changes against any previously published version(s) in Ballerina Central. Currently, the tool can be used to: 
- list down the source code differences (along with its compatibility impact) between the local and any published versions in Ballerina central
- suggest the new package version based on the compatibility impact of source code changes

Refer to the examples below which demonstrate few key functionalities of the semver CLI tool.

- version suggestions
```
$bal semver             
checking for the latest compatible release version available in central...

current version: 1.2.2-SNAPSHOT
compatibility impact (compared with the release version '1.2.1'): backward-incompatible changes detected
suggested version: 2.0.0
```

- version suggestions with the list of source code changes
```
$bal semver --show-diff
checking for the latest compatible release version available in central...

=========================================================================
 Comparing version '1.2.2-SNAPSHOT'(local) with version '1.2.1'(central) 
=========================================================================
[+-] package 'io' is modified [version impact: MAJOR]
  [+-] module 'io' is modified [version impact: MAJOR]
    [++] function 'printlnNew' is added [version impact: MINOR]

```
##### CLI

Introduced the `bal graph` CLI command, which resolves the dependencies of the current package and prints the dependency graph in the console. This produces the textual representation of the dependency graph using the DOT graph description language.

```ballerina
$ bal graph
digraph "org/package:0.1.0" {
        node [shape=record]
        "org/package" [label="<0.1.0> org/package:0.1.0"];
        "ballerina/io" [label="<1.2.2> ballerina/io:1.2.2"];

        // Edges
        "org/package":"0.1.0" -> "ballerina/io":"1.2.2";
}
```

### Breaking changes

### Developer tools updates

#### New features

##### OpenAPI Tool
Added support for generating client resource methods in the client generation command. The preferred client method type can be chosen using the `--client-methods=<remote(default)|resource>` option.
  - `$ bal openapi -i <OpenAPI contract> --client-methods=resource`
  - `$ bal openapi -i <OpenAPI contract> --mode client --client-methods=resource`

#### Improvements

##### OpenAPI Tool
Added support for OpenAPI schema constraint properties in client/service generation. With this improvement, the OpenAPI constraints will be applied as `ballerina/constraint` standard library package annotations when generating Ballerina clients and services from the OpenAPI definition.
The following OpenAPI properties are currently supported in the Ballerina OpenAPI generation tool. 
- `minimum`, `maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, and `exclusiveMaximum` for `integer` and `number` types
- `minLength` and `maxLength` for `string` type
- `minItems` and `maxItems` for `array` type

### Ballerina packages updates

#### New features

Introduced an `include` field under the `[package]` table in `Ballerina.toml`. It accepts a string array of paths to any additional files and directories, which need to be packed in the BALA file. The path should be relative to the package root directory.

```ballerina
[package]
org = "samjs"
name = "winery"
version = "0.1.0"
include = [documents/”, "images/sample.png"]
```

<!-- <style>.cGitButtonContainer, .cBallerinaTocContainer {display:none;}</style> -->
