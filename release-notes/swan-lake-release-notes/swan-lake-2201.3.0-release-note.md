## Overview of Ballerina Swan Lake 2201-3-0

<em>2201.3.0 (Swan Lake) is the third major release of 2022, and it includes a new set of features and significant improvements to the compiler, runtime, standard library, and developer tooling. It is based on the 2022R3 version of the Language Specification.</em> 

## Update Ballerina

**If you are already using Ballerina 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)**, run either of the commands below to directly update to 2201-3-0 using the [Ballerina Update Tool](/learn/cli-documentation/update-tool/).

`bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201-3-0`)

**If you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)**, run the commands below to update to 2201-3-0.

1. Run `bal update` to get the latest version of the Update Tool.

2. Run `bal dist update` ( or `bal dist pull 2201-3-0`) to update your Ballerina version to 2201-3-0.

However, if you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake) and if you already ran `bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201-3-0`) before `bal update`, see [Troubleshooting](/downloads/swan-lake-release-notes/2201-0-0-swan-lake/#troubleshooting) to recover your installation.

## Install Ballerina

## Runtime updates

### New features

### Improvements

#### Strand dump showing the total strand count

The total number of strand groups and strands created in a Ballerina program is now shown in the strand dump.

#### Allow ambiguous target types in `fromJsonWithType` & `cloneWithType`

The `fromJsonWithType` & `cloneWithType` functions returned an error in the earlier implementation when the user-specified target type was a union type consisting of multiple convertible types for a given source value. Now, for such user-specified target types, the operation succeeds without returning an error by returning a value whose inherent type is as follows. If the given source value belongs to at least one of the member types of the target union type, the inherent type of the returned value is the first found type to which the source value belongs. Otherwise, the inherent type of the returned value is the first convertible type in the union.

For example, the following operations will not return an error.

```ballerina
type PetByAge record {
    int age;
    string nickname?;
};

type PetByType record {
    "Cat"|"Dog" pet_type;
    boolean hunts?;
};

type Pet PetByAge|PetByType;

public function main() {
    json j = {
        "nickname": "Fido",
        "pet_type": "Dog",
        "age": 4
    };
    Pet|error pet = j.fromJsonWithType(); // inherent type of pet will be PetByAge

    j = {x: 1};
    record {float x;}|record {int x;}|error v = j.cloneWithType(); // inherent type of v will be record {int x;}
}
```

#### Configurable support for the array of tables

The configurable feature is improved to support the array of tables using a two-dimensional TOML array of in-line tables.

For example, if the configurable variables are defined in the following way,

```ballerina
type Person record {
    readonly int id;
    string name;
};

configurable table<map<int>>[] array1 = ?;
configurable table<Person> key (id)[] array2 = ?;
```

the values can be provided in the `Config.toml` file as follows.

```toml
array1 = [[{a = 1, b = 2}, {c = 3, d = 4}], [{e = 5, f = 6}]]

array2 = [[{id = 1, name = "Anne"}, {id = 2, name = "Bob"}], [{id = 3, name = "Charles"}]]

```

#### Configurable support for nil type

The configurable feature is now improved to support the following `()` cases.

- configurable variables of nil type 
The configurable variables with nil type are now supported if the configuration is optional.

For example, the following will be initialized with the default values without providing a compilation error.

```ballerina
configurable () nilValue = ();
configurable ())[] nilArray = [];
```

- record fields with nil type
The record fields of nil type or a union of nil are now supported by the configurable feature only if the field contains a default value.

For example, if the configurable variables are defined in the following way,

```ballerina
type Person record {
    int id;
    string name;
    string? department = "HR";
};

configurable Person person = ?;
```

the values can be provided in the `Config.toml` file as follows.

```toml
person = {id = 101, name = "Tom"}
```

#### Configurable support for `json` type
As `json` is a sub-type of `anydata`, it is now supported by the configurable feature.

For example, if the configurable variables are defined in the following way,

```ballerina
configurable json jsonVar = ?;
```

the values can be provided in the `Config.toml` file as follows.

```toml
jsonVar = {stringValue = "string", num = 12, arr = [1, 2, "hello"], map = {a = "a"}}
```

#### Configurable support for array filler values

The configurable feature is now improved to include filler values while configuring array values.

For example, if the configurable variable is defined in the following way,

```ballerina
configurable int[5] arr = ?;
```
the values are provided in the `Config.toml` as follows.

```toml
arr = [1, 2]
```
It will create an array with the `[1,2,0,0,0]` elements because the filler value of `int` type is `0`.

## Developer tools updates

### New features

#### Language Server

- Introduced new `Extract to local variable` code action
- Introduced new `Extract to function` code action
- Introduced `loadProject()` API to the workspace manager
- Introduced a new code action to generate module for client declarations (`Generate module for client declaration`)

#### CLI

##### Native-image build (Experimental)
Introduced the `--native` flag, which generates a GraalVM native executable when building a Ballerina project.
- The generated executable contains the modules in the current package, their dependencies, Ballerina runtime, and statically linked native code from the JDK.
- `bal build --native`

#### Ballerina Shell

#### Ballerina Update Tool

#### GraphQL Tool
- Added support to generate graphQL client definitions using graphQL IDL(i.e. config) files

#### Debugger

* Introduced the run-in-terminal feature, which provides the capability to debug Ballerina programs (that take user inputs) in the launch mode. This can be achieved by setting the `terminal` attribute in the launch configurations to `integrated`. Once the configuration is set, launching the debugger will cause the Ballerina programs to be executed in a separate integrated VS Code terminal.

### Improvements

#### Language Server
- Improved completions sorting within the expression of the `if` condition
- Improved `Change variable type` code action

#### Ballerina Shell

#### Ballerina Update Tool

#### GraphQL Tool 
- Introduced single client generation for single schema definition
- Improved the GraphQL client config generation to support runtime configurability
