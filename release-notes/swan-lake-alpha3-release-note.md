### Highlights

### What is new in Ballerina Swan Lake Alpha3

#### Language

##### Support for Module level complex variables

Variable declarations with list, mapping, and error binding patterns are now allowed at module level. Unlike simple variables, these variables must be initialized in the declaration.

Complex variable declarations cannot contain `isolated` or `configurable` qualifier.

```ballerina
// Module-level variable declaration with a list binding pattern. 
[int, float] [a, b] = [1, 2.5];

// Module-level variable declaration with a mapping binding pattern.
Person {name: firstname, married: isMarried} = {name: "Jhone", married: true};

type Person record {|
    string name;
    boolean married;
|};

// Module-level variable declaration with an error binding pattern.
error error(message) = error("error message");
```

##### Support for Module-level Public Variables

Module-level variables can now be declared as public using the `public` qualifier. Such variables will be visible outside the modules in which they are declared.

Isolated variables and variables declared with `var` cannot be declared as public variables.

```ballerina
public string publicName = "Ballerina";

public [int, float] [a, b] = [1, 2.5];
```

##### Improvement to Annotation Attachment with Empty Mapping Constructor Expression

If the type of the annotation is a mapping type for which an empty mapping constructor is valid, the mapping constructor expression is no longer mandatory in the annotation attachment.

The absence of the mapping constructor expression in such an annotation attachment is equivalent to specifying a mapping constructor expression with no fields.
```ballerina
type Annot record {|
    int[] i = [];
|};

public annotation Annot v1 on function;

@v1 // Same as `@v1 {}`
public function main() {
}
```

##### Improved lang library functions

###### New `xml:text()` function

This function can be used to select all the items in a sequence that are of type `xml:Text`.

```ballerina
xml name = xml `<name>Dan<middleName>Gerhard</middleName><!-- This is a comment -->Brown</name>`;
xml:Text nameText = (name/*).text();
io:println(nameText); // "DanBrown"
```
