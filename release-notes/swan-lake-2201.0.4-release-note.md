## Overview of Ballerina Swan Lake 2201.0.4

<em>Swan Lake 2201.0.4 is the fourth patch release of Ballerina 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake) and it includes a new set of bug fixes to the compiler, runtime, standard library, and developer tooling.</em> 

## Updating Ballerina

>**Info:** It is recommended to update your active Ballerina distribution to 2201.0.4 as soon as possible because from now onwards, new updates of standard libraries and extensions will not be available for the previous releases.

**If you are already using Ballerina 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)**, run either of the commands below to directly update to 2201.0.4 (Swan Lake) using the [Ballerina Update Tool](/learn/cli-documentation/update-tool/).

`bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201.0.4`)

**If you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)**, run the commands below to update to 2201.0.4 (Swan Lake).

1. Run `bal update` to get the latest version of the Update Tool.

2. Run `bal dist update` ( or `bal dist pull 2201.0.4`) to update your Ballerina version to 2201.0.4 (Swan Lake).

However, if you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake) and if you already ran `bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201.0.4`) before `bal update`, see [Troubleshooting](/downloads/swan-lake-release-notes/2201-0-0-swan-lake/#troubleshooting) to recover your installation.
